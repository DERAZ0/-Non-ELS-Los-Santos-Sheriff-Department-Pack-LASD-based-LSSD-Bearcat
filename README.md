# -Non-ELS-Los-Santos-Sheriff-Department-Pack-LASD-based-LSSD-Bearcat
Hello everyone. This pack contains 14 Los Santos Sheriff Department vehicles. I’m not the creator of these vehicles. I just installed these liveries https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-lssd-livery-pack-for-socaltheros-lspd-pack/2604388 on these cars https://forum.cfx.re/t/non-els-lore-livery-friendly-lapd-vehicle-pack-working-spotlight-working-ta-bar-on-scene-lights/2492192. I haven’t seen anyone else do this, so I decided to post this carpack to make it easier for server creators.
